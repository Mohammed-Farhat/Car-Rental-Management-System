# Car-Rental-Management-System

A full-featured Car Rental Management System developed using **Python** and **MySQL**, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) built with **Tkinter**.

The system provides separate panels for both users and administrators. Regular users can browse available cars, view specifications, rent vehicles with insurance options, return them, and view their transaction logs. Administrators can manage the car inventory by adding, editing, or removing cars and adjusting rental costs.

Security is a key aspect of the system, with password hashing implemented using **bcrypt**, and role-based access control (admin/user) enforced at login.
